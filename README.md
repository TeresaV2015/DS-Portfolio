# Principal Component Analysis 

This folder contains four documents: PCA_Pizza.Rmd, PCA_Pizza.docx, Pizza.csv, and "Principal Component Analysis Handout" document. These documents were created in conjunction with two other people for a class (Probability and Statistics 2) for our final project.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be complicated to understand, so our goal was to design a small coding exercise with an accompanying documnent with detailed explanations and additional reading resources for our classmates.
