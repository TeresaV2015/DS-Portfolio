## Probability and Statistics 2 Course (Spring 2022)

This folder contains four documents: PCA_Pizza.Rmd, PCA_Pizza.docx, Pizza.csv, and "Principal Component Analysis Handout" document. These documents were created in conjunction with two other people for a class (Probability and Statistics 2) for our final project.
